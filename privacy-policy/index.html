Navigational Information may include unique data, such as your IP address. Many of the products we offer, including insurance products, are tailored to your location. You can adjust your browser settings to change which web tracking technologies are allowed while using our Services, although this may impact their performance. Similarly, most mobile devices provide options to disable geo-location data collection, but doing so might also affect the functionality of our Services.</p>

                    <h3>What Are Cookies</h3>
                    <p>A cookie is a small file that contains a string of characters and is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you return to the site, the cookie allows it to recognize your browser. Cookies can store user preferences and other information.</p>
                    <p>Cookies set by Alex AI Insurtech are referred to as "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than us are known as "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable the provision of features or functionalities from third parties on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The entities that place these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits our website and when it accesses certain other websites.</p>

                    <h3>Why We Use Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We utilize both first-party and third-party cookies for various reasons. Some cookies are necessary for technical purposes to ensure our website operates correctly, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies help us track and target user interests to enhance the overall experience on our website. For instance, Alex AI Insurtech monitors the website and pages you visit within our platform to identify which sections are most popular or frequently accessed. This information is used to deliver tailored content and promotions within the Alex AI Insurtech website to users whose behavior indicates interest in specific topics. Third parties may also serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other functions, as detailed below.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Cookies We Use and How We Use Them</h3>
                    <p>The specific types of cookies utilized on our website and their purposes are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Essential Website Cookies:</strong> These cookies are crucial for providing you with services available on our website. Since they are strictly necessary for delivering the website, you cannot opt out of them. However, you can block or delete these cookies by adjusting your browser settings as explained below.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are not essential for its use. Without these cookies, certain features may become unavailable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies gather information that is used in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is utilized or to assess the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, as well as to customize our website according to your preferences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies aim to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions such as preventing the same ad from appearing repeatedly, ensuring that ads are displayed correctly for advertisers, and, in some cases, selecting advertisements based on your interests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Networking Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our website through third-party social networks and other websites. Additionally, these cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How Can You Control Cookies?</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to choose whether to accept or decline cookies. You can manage your cookie preferences by using the provided opt-out links below. Additionally, you can adjust your web browser settings to either accept or reject cookies. Note that if you choose to disable cookies, you may still access our website, but some features or sections might be restricted.</p>
                    <p>The methods for refusing cookies vary by browser, so consult your browser’s help menu for further guidance. Many advertising networks also offer an option to opt out of targeted ads. To learn more, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com. You can opt out by visiting http://preferences.truste.com/.</p>
                    <p>Please be aware that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads altogether. You will still receive general advertisements.</p>

                    <h3>Other Tracking Technologies, Such as Web Beacons</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are not the only tools we use to identify or monitor visitors to our website. We also use a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs) to help us assess the effectiveness of the website and our subscription service by showing us which content resonates with users. Clear gifs are small graphics with unique identifiers, functioning similarly to cookies, and are used to monitor the online movements of website visitors. Unlike cookies, which are saved on the hard drive of your device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails, and are typically no larger than the period at the end of this sentence. We use these clear gifs or pixels in HTML-based emails to track which emails have been opened. This enables us to measure the impact of our communications and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We link the information collected through clear gifs in emails to our customers’ Personal Information.</p>

                    <h2>6. Data Retention Policy</h2>
                    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law. The retention period depends on the nature of the data and the purposes for which it was collected. After expiration of the retention period, personal data is securely deleted or anonymized</p>

                    <h2>7. For California Residents</h2>
                    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), effective January 1, 2020, grants California residents specific rights regarding access to and deletion of their “Personal Information” as well as the option to opt out of the sale of this information. Under the CCPA, businesses are also required to include disclosures in their privacy policies regarding how they collect, use, and share Personal Information. This section provides the disclosures that Alex AI Insurtech LLC is required to make under the CCPA and outlines the rights available to California residents.</p>
                    <p>In this section, “Personal Information” refers to information as defined by Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(o), as updated from time to time. If there is any conflict between the provisions in this section and other parts of this Privacy Policy, the provisions in this section take precedence for California residents.</p>

                    <h3>Categories of Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold in the Past 12 Months</h3>
                    <p>The table below outlines the categories of Personal Information that Alex AI Insurtech LLC has collected within the last 12 months from the effective date of this Privacy Policy. For each category, it specifies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Whether Alex AI Insurtech has sold the category of Personal Information to a third party or disclosed it for a business purpose.</li>
                        <li>The categories of third parties to whom the information was disclosed or sold.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This table does not include Personal Information provided to us in a business-to-business context by partners or other customers.</p>

                    <h3>Non-Discrimination and Service Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Alex AI Insurtech LLC will not discriminate against users who exercise their CCPA rights. However, we may provide different prices, levels, or quality of services if such differences are reasonably related to the value of a user’s data. Additionally, we may offer financial incentives in exchange for the collection, sale, or deletion of Personal Information.</p>
                    <p>Certain Personal Information is necessary for us to deliver our Services. For example, to provide an accurate insurance quote, we must collect specific details about you. If you choose not to provide essential information, you may be unable to access some or all of our Services.</p>

                    <h3>Submitting Requests to Know, Opt-Out, or Delete Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>California residents may exercise their rights to access, opt-out of the sale of their data, or request data deletion by completing the form available at "Do Not Sell My Data," emailing us at privacy@alexai.cloud or calling us (480)-630-9630.</p>
                    <p>Before sharing any Personal Information or processing an Opt-Out or Deletion request, we may require verification of your identity. If Alex AI Insurtech LLC is unable to verify your identity, we will respond to explain the reason.</p>
                    <p>Within 10 business days, we will confirm receipt of a Request to Know. Our response will typically be provided within 45 days. Should additional time be necessary, we will inform you of the reason for the delay, extending the response time up to an additional 45 days if needed. We are not required to provide Personal Information more than twice in a 12-month period. In cases where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, a reasonable fee may apply, or we may refuse to process the request(s).</p>
                    <p>Once verified, we will (a) honor the request or (b) where applicable, explain if the CCPA does not mandate action regarding your Personal Information. Alex AI Insurtech LLC may delete information by de-identifying, aggregating, or permanently erasing it.</p>

                    <h3>Authorized Agents</h3>
                    <p>California residents may designate an authorized agent to submit Requests to Know, Opt-Out, or Delete on their behalf. Unless the agent provides Alex AI Insurtech LLC with a power of attorney executed by the California resident, we may require the California resident to confirm their identity with us and/or provide written authorization for the agent to make the request.</p>

                    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice</h3>
                    <p>California enacted A.B. 370, amending the California Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires website operators like Alex AI Insurtech LLC to disclose responses to "Do Not Track" signals and any third-party collection of personally identifiable information.</p>

                    <p>We do not permit the collection of personally identifiable information from our users by third parties through advertising technologies unless separate consent is provided.</p>
